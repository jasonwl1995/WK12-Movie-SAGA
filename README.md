# Movie Browsing

## Description:

Duration: 3 Day Sprint
Users can use this application to look through the movies in a database. If one movie catches their interest they may click on the movie image and will be brought the the details page of the movie where they can find the movie title, description, and genre as well as a movie poster image. They may also add any movie they would like on a separate page, which would post the new movie to the home page upon clicking the 'Save' button. 

### Prerequisites:
- node.js
- React
- Redux
- Postico
- PostgreSQL

## Installation:
1. Create a database called saga_movies_weekend
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
3. Open up coding app of choice and run npm install in terminal.
4. Run 'npm run server' in your terminal.
5. Run 'npm run client' in your terminal, this should open a new tab for you in your browser.

## Usage:
1. List(home) page will display all movies (titles and poster images) in the database.
